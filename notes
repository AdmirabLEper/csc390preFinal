Use willActivate for screens that will need to generate an updated version of its table (or picker) every time it loads,
	Use awakeWithContext if the table only needs to be generated once.
In order to create a "bridge" between the phone and the watch:
	On both Watch and Phone:
		import WatchConnectivity (with the other imports)
		On the class definition line, add "WCSessionDelegate":
			class mainScreen: WKInterfaceController, WCSessionDelegate
		Add the below into awakeWithContext (Watch) or ViewController/viewDidLoad (Phone):
			if WCSession.isSupported()
			{
				let session = WCSession.defaultSession()
				session.delegate = self
				session.activateSession()
			}
