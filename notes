Use willActivate for screens that will need to generate an updated version of its table (or picker) every time it loads,
	Use awakeWithContext if the table only needs to be generated once.
In order to create a "bridge" between the phone and the watch:
	import WatchConnectivity

	if WCSession.isSupported() 
	{
            self.session = WCSession.defaultSession()
            session.delegate = self
            session.activateSession()
        }
